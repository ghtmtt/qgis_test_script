* **basicstatisticsfornumericfields** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * algorithm not in the toolbox, replaced by basicstatisticsforfields  

* **basicstatisticsfortextfields** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * algorithm not in the toolbox, replaced by basicstatisticsforfields  

* **concavehull** algorithm or test not working!

 * ticket: 

  * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15985 

* **definecurrentprojection** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **executesql** algorithm or test not working!

 * commit: 

  * 83a24884f9b77df7236e77f4c0ba798d91b81169 

 * note: 

  * algorithm works nice, but test fails. Thanks to the test, outputname fixed. Anyway, a commit has been made to change the output name of the algorithm 

* **frequencyanalysis** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * bug with the algorithm 

 * ticket: 

  * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16133 

* **importintopostgis** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **importintospatialite** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **postgisexecutesql** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **randomextract** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

 * ticket: 

  * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16069 

* **randompointsinlayerbounds** algorithm or test not working!

 * commit: 

  * a6439cb48f2c69dda848c72e4e8b7faef54bc2a6 

 * note: 

  * random test point created in the test HAVE TO be different from source layer. Tricky test to upload 

 * parameter: 

  * standard 

  * with buffer

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **randomselectionwithinsubsets** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **selectbyattribute** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **selectbylocation** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **setstyleforrasterlayer** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **setstyleforvectorlayer** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * output not uploadable for the test 

* **statisticsbycategories** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * could be related to the table output, as for frequency analysis
