* **gdal2xyz** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * seems working but dbf in output not suitable for the test 

* **importlayertableasgeometrylesstableintopostgresqldatabase** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * not working and output not uploadable for the test 

* **importvectorintopostgisdatabaseavailableconnections** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * works, but output not uploadable for the test 

* **importvectorintopostgisdatabasenewconnection** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * not working and output not uploadable for the test 

* **polygonize** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * works also for GML output, but test fails due to CRS, also Alex made the test, no more in the code https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/159fda68f2e3ac0c557a3b2e166dc24f95ad83ed#diff-21dd2d61eb16fd109e496b2a91abe493

 * note: 

  * cannot open the output 

 * ticket: 

  * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16276 

* **warpreproject** algorithm or test not working!

 * note: 

  * algorithm cannot run and reproject layers
